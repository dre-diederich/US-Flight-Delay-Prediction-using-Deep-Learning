# US-Flight-Delay-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning
This project leverages deep learning techniques to predict flight delays across the United States. Using historical flight data, flight origin / destination, arrival delays, travel time, and airline information, the model provides delay predictions to help airlines, airports, and travelers make more informed decisions.
