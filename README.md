# US-Flight-Delay-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning
This project leverages deep learning techniques to predict flight delays across the United States. Using historical flight data, flight origin / destination, arrival delays, travel time, and airline information, the model provides delay predictions to help airlines, airports, and travelers make more informed decisions.

# Features
Deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Visualization of delay patterns across airlines and airports

Model evaluation and performance metrics

Interactive Jupyter notebooks for exploration

# Dataset
Historical US domestic flight data sourced from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and supplemented with weather data.

 # Goals
Predict flight arrival delays based on scheduled data

Identify key features contributing to delays

Explore potential for real-time prediction applications
